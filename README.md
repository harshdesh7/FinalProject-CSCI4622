The code here has the code for the webapp deployment. For the actual model development code, check out the iPython notebook link below

## Other notes:

I could not upload my trained model to the Github as its file size exceeded 200 MB, which is GitHub's maximum file size limit. The name of my trained model was `final_model.m5`, which you may see in some of the code
